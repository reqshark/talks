# tiny messages for big architectures
Imagine a world where upgrading applications is seamless; where there are no
gaps between the architecture that serves your first few users to the system
that powers a million.

Using `nanomsg`'s scalability protocols seamless architecture becomes reality.
In his talk Yosh will explain the philosophy of `nanomsg` and the patterns to
reliably architect software that scales.

-----------------
## A little bit more
As a contractor most projects I've encountered were built as monoliths, taking
great effort to refactor and unwrap into different services. I found there
usually is a great divide between the initial (JS) application and the system
that requires to be run on a cluster, and as such would like to give a talk on
how to prevent running into (critical) scaling issues from the start of a
project.

In this talk I'll show how the nanomsg POSIX compliant sockets can be
integrated into Node.js for both in-process and (networked) inter-process
communication. At the end of the talk the audience should have a good feeling
for the ideas underlying nanomsg, an overview of staple architecture patterns
and the right resources to further investigate further.

## About
I'm a freelance software engineer who's been an active member of the Node.js
community for a while. Apart from in-house training I've done a [fair amount of
public speaking](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/talks) and been involved with
numerous [nodeschool](https://github.com/nodeschool) events ðŸŒ¿..
