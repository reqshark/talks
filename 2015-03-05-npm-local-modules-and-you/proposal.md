In this talk Yoshua will take you into the brave new world of NPM 2's local modules and show (some very practical) methods on how to structure applications following the unix philosophy.

For organizers only:
==================
The goal is to give people some practical information on how to use npm 2.0, linklocal (https://github.com/timoxley/linklocal), npm scoped modules and project structuring. So far information about local modules is scarcely available, and both Nodesource and wercker haven't published any articles about linklocal yet so it'll probably be new information for everyone in the audience. Thanks!
