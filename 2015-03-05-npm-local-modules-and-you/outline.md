- Welcome

- whoami

- Talk about unix principles
    - tell people what they are (commandments of programming)
    - explain a bit about abstractions and interfaces

- Talk about architecture anno now
    - example of paths (../../../)
    - example of `node_modules` (and errors with tooling)

- Show example of requiring a file
    - Solves problems of deeply nested paths
    - Solves problem of inflexible code & hard refactors
    - Might want to do an example with the file tree in there

- Show example of namespaces
    - Solves problem of ambiguous names
    - Compatible with npm namespaces

- Show example of symlinks
    - Solves problem of development

- Show example of flat directory structure
    - Neatly defined dependencies
    - Easy to break out functionality
    - Easy to open source
    - Amount of modules shouldn't matter
    - Just gradually grind up abstractions
    - And keep on releasing modules

- Notes
    - Works for both frontend & backend
    - Integrates with private registry / tar store
    - Start with a monolith, but plan ahead
