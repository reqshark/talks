You cannot fix what you don't know is broken. Keeping logs and handling errors
is crucial for any application in production. In this talk yosh will show you
how to sustainably approach logs and error handling for applications on any
scale.

## For organizers only
Though errors and logging might not seem to be the most exciting of subjects,
there exists a great deal of confusion and ad-hoc solutions to this in the Node
community. In this talk I'll explain the basic principles and gotchas behind
logging in Node. It's going to be a combination of unix tools, data formats,
npm packages and architecture.

Hopefully I'll be able to nudge people in the right direction so they can
continue learning on their own.
