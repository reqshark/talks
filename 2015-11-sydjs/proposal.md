Streams are a control flow abstraction native to node to read, transform and
write data. Streams are composable, efficient and easy! Yes, really. In this
talk Yosh will show you the exciting world of streams, and show you how you can
include them in your next project.

For organizers only:
--------------------
Streams are one of Node's features developers are least familiar with, and
that's sad because most of Node core's development is done with streams in
mind.

I'll mix introductory material with demo's (possibly WebRTC / LevelDB stuff) to
keep it interesting for the full range of attendees.
Hopefully it'll be enough to get people both excited for streams and enable
them to continue on their own.
