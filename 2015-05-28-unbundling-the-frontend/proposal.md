# proposal
previous talks included:
- local modules
- neat modules for the client

Feel like talking about something related, but different this time. Breaking
stuff apart is very important, and the client is missing a uniform way of doing
this. Talking about killing frameworks is controversial; how else would one
structure applications right? *cough*

What we're going to talk about here is how we can stop repeating ourselves
every time the next big thing pops up. Lock in is holding us back, common
interfaces are the way forward.

## Unbundling the frontend
The great unbundling is upon us! Backend engineers talk microservices, but us
on the frontend are building mostly monoliths. How can we unbundle our clients
without repeating ourselves? How can we prepare our code to be compatible with
The Next Big Framework? (And the one after that?) Let me show you a glimpse of
the future.
